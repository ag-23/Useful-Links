		1. By GUI of Y-ppa manager
		2. (a) sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys <PUBKEY>
				(where <PUBKEY> is your missing public key for repository, e.g. 8BAF9A6F)
		   (b) sudo apt-get update	
<<<<<<< HEAD
		3. (a) gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key <pubkey>

--> If you feel that the system volume is less (in usual or in comparison to windows) then
		1. Firstly check alsamixer (type in command line and check all the volumes--use arrow keys and Esc key to exit)

		2. Else install paman (sudo apt-get install paman)...go to dash and search for Pulse Audio Volume Control and then the volumes as per your requirements..This can set the volumes much greater than 100% also .

--> If you want to get updates in unsupported versions of ubuntu like in 14.10/15.10/16.10 etc. then we have to change mirrors in
/etc/apt/sources.list from "archive.ubuntu.com" and "security.ubuntu.com" to "old-releases.ubuntu.com".
